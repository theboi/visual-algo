## About

Built to allow users to picture algorithms graphically, _Algorithm Visualiser_ includes algorithms such as sorting.

Made with React, Next.js, and TypeScript (Superset of JavaScript).

This project was inspired by [a project](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Sorting-Visualizer) by [Cl√©ment Mihailescu](https://github.com/clementmihailescu).

## Algorithms

### Sorting

| Algorithm | Time | Space |
| - | - | - |
| Bubble Sort | O(n^2) | O(1) |
| Quicksort | O(n log n) | O(log n) |
| Mergesort | O(n log n) | O(n) |
| Heapsort | O(n log n) | O(1) |
| Insertion Sort | O(n^2) | O(1) |
| Timsort | O(n log n) | O(n) |
